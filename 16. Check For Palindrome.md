A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

>Example 1:

>Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
>Output: true
>Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

>Example 2:
>Input: s = "race a car"
>Output: false
>Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

>Example 3:
>Input: s = " "
>Output: true
>Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
>Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.


#### Learning from the problem

In the implementation I provided earlier, the expression `new StringBuilder(s)` creates a new `StringBuilder` object initialized with the contents of the `String` object `s`. The `StringBuilder` class in Java is a mutable sequence of characters that allows efficient modification of a string.

The `StringBuilder` class provides various methods to modify the sequence of characters, such as `append()`, `insert()`, `delete()`, and `reverse()`. In the case of checking if a string is a palindrome, we use the `reverse()` method to reverse the characters in the string.

After calling `new StringBuilder(s)`, we can call the `reverse()` method on the `StringBuilder` object to get a reversed version of the string. Finally, we convert the `StringBuilder` object back to a `String` using the `toString()` method and compare it to the original string `s` using the `equals()` method to check if they are the same. If they are the same, then the original string is a palindrome.
