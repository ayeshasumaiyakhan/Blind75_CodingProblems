## IMP Notes: 

> **The Magic code** The line `if(currSum<0){ currSum = 0; }` is checking if the current sum `currSum` is negative. 
> If it is negative, then the code sets `currSum` to 0. 
> This is done to handle the case where a negative sum will not contribute to the maximum sum of a subarray, so it's better to start a new subarray at the next element.

> For example, 
> consider the array `nums = [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]`. 
> The current sum at the second element `-3` is `-2 + -3 = -5`, which is negative. Since a negative sum will not contribute to



```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        // int curr_max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
         int currSum = 0;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for( int i =0;i <nums.length;i++){
            
            currSum += nums[i];
            if(currSum > max){
                max = currSum;
            }
            if(currSum<0){
                currSum = 0;
            }

### The Kadane's algorithm is an efficient algorithm used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array of numbers. It is widely used in several applications, including:

1. Image Processing: The Kadane's algorithm is used to find the maximum sum subarray in image processing applications, such as image thresholding, edge detection, and image segmentation.

2. Finance: The algorithm can be used to find the maximum profit that can be earned by buying and selling a stock on a given day.

3. Network Flow: The Kadane's algorithm can be used to find the maximum flow in a network, such as a pipeline, computer network, or transportation network.

4. Game Theory: The algorithm can be used to find the maximum sum in two-player games, such as the game of Nim.

5. Data Compression: The Kadane's algorithm can be used to find the longest common substring between two strings, which is useful in data compression.

Overall, the Kadane's algorithm has several applications in various fields and is considered one of the most efficient algorithms for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
