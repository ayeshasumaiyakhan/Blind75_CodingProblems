## Notes
#### The prefix sum algorithm, also known as cumulative sum, is a technique used to calculate cumulative sums of arrays. It's useful in solving problems that involve computing the sum of elements in a given range in an array. Here are a few examples of problems that can be solved using prefix sum:

1. Range Sum Query: Given an array of numbers, find the sum of elements in a specific range.
2. Counting Subarray Sums: Given an array of numbers, count the number of contiguous subarrays that have a sum equal to a given target value.
3. Subarray XOR: Given an array of numbers, find the XOR of all the subarrays.
4. Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an array of numbers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
5. Two-Dimensional Range Sum: Given a two-dimensional array, find the sum of elements in a specific rectangular region.

These are just a few examples, but prefix sum can be applied to a wide variety of problems involving arrays and sums. The key is to identify the problem as one that involves computing sums or finding ranges of elements in an array.

### How to identify the problem as one that involves computing sums
> To identify a problem as one that involves computing sums, you can look for certain keywords and phrases in the problem statement that suggest that a cumulative sum is needed. Here are some examples:

"sum of elements"
"total"
"range"
"subarray"
"contiguous"
"accumulated"
"cumulative"

> For example, if a problem statement says, "Find the sum of elements in a specific range in an array," it's clear that a cumulative sum is required. If a problem statement asks, "Count the number of contiguous subarrays with a sum equal to a target value," this also suggests that cumulative sums are needed.

Additionally, you can also look for problems that involve finding the maximum or minimum of a certain type of sum. For example, "Find the maximum sum of elements in a contiguous subarray" is a problem that requires cumulative sums.

So, to summarize, if a problem involves computing the sum of elements in a specific range or finding the maximum or minimum of a certain type of sum, it's likely that a cumulative sum, or prefix sum, algorithm can be used to solve it.
